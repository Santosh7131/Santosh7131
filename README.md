Hi, Iâ€™m R Santosh Kumaar! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at SRM KTR. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new things, especially when it comes to technology and coding. Whether itâ€™s building apps, solving problems, or just exploring different areas of tech, I enjoy being hands-on and figuring things out.
